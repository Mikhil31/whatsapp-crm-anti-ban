   * Sends a file into an existing thread (D-25). The bytes are the request body — not JSON, not
   * multipart — so the file never takes a second trip through a client-side encoder (the same shape
   * as the import upload, M3). `?filename=` names it and `?caption=` is optional text under it.
   *
   * Everything about the file is decided here from its bytes, never from what the client claims:
   * only images, video, audio, PDFs and ZIP/Office containers are accepted, because those are what
   * WhatsApp carries and what `detectMediaType` can vouch for. HTML, SVG and anything unrecognised
   * is refused outright rather than stored and sent. The thread lock applies exactly as it does to
   * a text reply. The message is queued like any other: the gateway reads the file from storage
   * and sends it through the same anti-ban policy.
