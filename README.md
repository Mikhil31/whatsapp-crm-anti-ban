# WhatsApp CRM

A generic, self-hostable conversation and outreach platform for WhatsApp — shared inbox,
contacts, campaigns, automation, and a real API — that runs on one small VPS and costs
nothing to operate.

> **Status: alpha build, moving fast.** WhatsApp is live end to end — link a number, send,
> receive, and media (both directions), verified against a real phone. Built: the shared inbox
> (assignment, status, filters, notes, canned replies, thread lock, attachments in and out),
> contacts with search, tags and dynamic segments, CSV/Excel import, campaigns with a full Broadcast
> UI (spintax, dry-run preview, per-recipient results), and an anti-ban policy seam (the first engine was
> removed on 2026-10-30; the new one is pending). Not built: the Meta Cloud API, message templates,
> webhooks and the OpenAPI/SDK, opt-out automation, inbox search, deployment. Build phases are tracked in
> [`docs/17-roadmap.md`](docs/17-roadmap.md); current state and the work ledger are
> [`HANDOFF.md`](HANDOFF.md) and [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

## What it is

A messaging CRM that treats WhatsApp as **one adapter behind a port**, not as the product:

- **Shared inbox** — two-way conversations, assignment, collision detection, internal notes.
- **Contacts** — custom fields, tags, segments, identity-based dedup. No domain assumptions.
- **Campaigns** — segment, schedule, drip, opt-out, per-recipient status, cost estimate.
- **Anti-ban policy** — a random 3 to 8 second gap between sends from one number and a small campaign batch,
  behind one interface, plus human-like typing. See [`docs/08-antiban.md`](docs/08-antiban.md).
- **Pluggable ingestion** — Excel/CSV, Google Sheets, REST, webhooks, scheduled syncs, with
  a mapping UI, dry run, and a per-row error ledger.
- **Public API + webhooks** — everything the UI can do, any other app can do.

Two WhatsApp transports, chosen per message by intent: **Baileys** (free, unofficial, for
bulk outreach) and the **Meta Cloud API** (paid, official, for anything business-critical).

## What it is not

It does not own your business domain. There is no `candidate` table, no `deal`, no `ticket`.
Domain objects live in whatever system owns them; the CRM references them by `external_ref`
and stores user-defined fields. That is what makes it reusable — as a standalone CRM, or as
a module inside a larger product ([`docs/16-integration-jobportal.md`](docs/16-integration-jobportal.md)).

## Honest warnings

Read these before deciding to use it.

- **Baileys is unofficial and against WhatsApp's Terms of Service.** Running it against a
  normal number can get that number banned, permanently, with no appeal. The anti-ban engine
  substantially reduces the risk; it cannot eliminate it. Reported industry figures put ~68%
  of Indian SMBs using unofficial automation hitting at least one ban within 12 months.
  Never point it at a number you cannot afford to lose. Anything your business depends on
  should go through the official Cloud API.
- **Bulk messaging is regulated almost everywhere** — consent and an easy opt-out are the norm
  (India's DPDP, the EU's GDPR, US TCPA, and others). This is a generic tool used worldwide, so it
  bakes in no single regime: it gives you neutral tooling (do-not-contact, opt-out, an audit trail,
  data export/delete) and **meeting your own jurisdiction's rules is yours**. See
  [`docs/09-security.md`](docs/09-security.md).
- **The official API costs money per template message.** Roughly ₹0.86 marketing and
  ₹0.145 utility/auth in India as of 2026; replies inside the 24-hour service window are free.

## Running it

Verified end to end on 2026-09-19: a real number linked, a real message sent and delivered.

**Fresh clone? [GETTING_STARTED.md](GETTING_STARTED.md)** is the full step-by-step
(prerequisites, secrets, database, provisioning, running, troubleshooting). The short version:

### What you need

- **Node 22+** and **Docker** (for Postgres). Nothing else.

### Setup, once

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kushalr3ddy/whatsapp-crm.git && cd whatsapp-crm
npm install
[ -f .env ] || cp .env.example .env     # never clobber an existing one
```

> The guard matters. A plain `cp .env.example .env` over a working install overwrites
> `ENCRYPTION_KEY`, and **that is the one secret with no recovery** — every stored message and
> every linked number becomes unreadable. Back it up somewhere that is not the repo and not the
> database, and name the backup something `.gitignore` already covers.

Then fill in the five required secrets in `.env`. Every one is a hard crash at boot if
missing — never a silent fallback:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32     # APP_SECRET
openssl rand -hex 32     # ENCRYPTION_KEY
openssl rand -hex 32     # ENCRYPTION_INDEX_KEY   (must DIFFER from ENCRYPTION_KEY)
openssl rand -hex 32     # API_KEY
```

`DATABASE_URL` for the bundled container is:

```
postgresql://dev:dev@localhost:5434/whatsapp_crm_dev
```

`PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000` is fine locally.

> **Back up `ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `ENCRYPTION_INDEX_KEY` in a password manager, now.** Losing
> `ENCRYPTION_KEY` means losing every linked number and every stored message, permanently — it
> is the only secret here that cannot be regenerated. Never store it alongside a database dump:
> a backup holding both the ciphertext and its key is a backup of plaintext.
> See [22 · Encryption](docs/22-encryption.md), and [D-9](docs/21-deferred.md) for why there is
> deliberately no generator script yet.

Start Postgres and create the schema — this does both databases, app and test:

```bash
npm run db:setup
```

### Running it

One terminal, everything:

```bash
npm run dev:all      # database, migrations, all three processes. Ctrl-C stops them
npm run dev:all -- --fast-web   # same, but the UI is a production build: use this on a slower laptop
```

It waits for each service to answer before reporting it ready, prints whether row-level
security is actually being enforced, and streams the three logs prefixed by which process
spoke. `--no-web` skips Next (much faster); `--no-gateway` runs without any WhatsApp
connection. Postgres is deliberately left running on Ctrl-C — it holds linked credentials.

**Then read [`docs/24-local-testing.md`](docs/24-local-testing.md)** for how to get a key and
exercise the API, attachments and the audit trail by hand.

#### Or three processes, one terminal each

They are separate on purpose: the gateway owns the WhatsApp sockets, so restarting the API
never drops a connection.

```bash
npm run dev          # API on :3000
```
```bash
npm run gateway      # owns the WhatsApp sockets — nothing sends without this
```
```bash
npm run web          # inbox UI on :3001
```

### Provisioning, once

Nothing works until an organisation exists. The `API_KEY` in `.env` is a **bootstrap**
credential — it can create an org and mint that org's first key, and is refused on every data
route.

```bash
npm run admin -- org --name "Your Company" --slug your-company --email you@example.com
```

That prints an org id and a generated password — **save both**. Sign in with them at
`http://localhost:3001/login`.

The UI needs no key of its own: it forwards your session to the API, so the API authorises
*you*, by your role. Integrations are different and do need a key:

```bash
npm run admin -- key --org <org-id> --name "job portal" --scopes messages:send,contacts:read
```

`npm run admin` on its own lists the commands; `whoami` lists organisations. How all of this
fits together, with diagrams: [23 · Authentication](docs/23-auth.md).

### Linking a number

A sender must exist first. Over HTTP that needs a key — mint one **once** with the command
above, then put the printed secret in your shell:

```bash
export CRM_API_KEY=crm_live_...
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/senders -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRM_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"label":"my number"}'
```

Then open **http://localhost:3001/link**, click **Link this number**, and scan the QR from
WhatsApp → **Settings → Linked Devices → Link a device**.

The QR expires in under a minute; click again for a fresh one. Once the socket opens the
sidebar reads **"1 number connected"** and the sender is promoted to `active` automatically.

### Sending

Open **http://localhost:3001/inbox**, pick a conversation, type, send. Or over HTTP:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/messages -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRM_API_KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"to":"+919876543210","body":"hello"}'
```

That returns **202, not 201** — accepted, not sent. The gateway does the sending, and the status
moves `queued → sent → delivered → read` in the thread. If nothing is linked the message stays
`queued` and goes out on its own once a number connects.

More requests to try by hand, with real responses, in
[15 · Public API](docs/15-api.md#trying-it-by-hand-insomnia-postman-curl).

### Checking it still works

```bash
npm run check        # typecheck (server + web) + lint + ~530 tests
```

`npm run` lists every script. [20 · Orientation](docs/20-orientation.md) explains the stack and
every term used in the docs, assuming no prior knowledge.

### Things that will catch you out

- **`npm run web:build` fails while `npm run web` is running** — both write `apps/web/.next`.
  Stop the dev server first.
- **Two databases in one container.** `whatsapp_crm_dev` holds real data *including WhatsApp
  credentials*; `whatsapp_crm_test` is what the suite truncates. Data lives in a named Docker
  volume and survives a restart.
- **Nothing sends without the gateway.** A queued message is not a failure — it is waiting.

### Deployment

Not done yet, and it is the point at which the production database gets chosen. The intended
shape is the `lean` preset: one app process, Postgres, Caddy — **~700 MB–1 GB RAM**, every v1
feature, no Redis, no object store, no telemetry.

| Preset | RAM | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| `lean` (default) | ~0.7–1 GB | One process, pg-boss queue, filesystem storage, static web |
| `standard` | ~2.5–3.5 GB | Split processes, Redis/BullMQ, MinIO, observability |
| `scale` | 8 GB+ | Replicas, managed Postgres, sharded gateways |
