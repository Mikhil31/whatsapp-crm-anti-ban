chapter('Importing contacts', `
<p>The import wizard takes a CSV or Excel (.xlsx) sheet and turns it into contacts. It works in three steps: <b>Upload</b>,
<b>Match columns</b>, <b>Review &amp; import</b>.</p>
<h3>Step 1 · Upload</h3>
${fig('07-import-upload', 'Step 1: drop a file or click to choose one.')}
<p>Drop your file on the box, or click it to choose one. It uploads straight away; there is no Upload button.</p>
<ul>
<li>Your sheet needs a <b>header row</b> on top and at least one person underneath.</li>
<li>The <b>same file cannot be imported twice</b>. If you upload identical bytes again you are told so, and an <b>Upload anyway</b> button
lets you start a fresh import (people already in the CRM are matched by phone or email and updated, not duplicated).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2 · Match columns</h3>
${fig('08-import-match', 'Step 2: tell the CRM what each column is.')}
${markers([
  [1, '<b>Which columns hold phone numbers?</b> Tick every column that has a number. If a person has more than one, they are tried in the order shown. Use <b>Another column holds numbers…</b> to add more. Numbers with no country code are read as Indian numbers.'],
  [2, '<b>Name and email.</b> Pick the column for the name (or join a first-name and a last-name column) and, optionally, the email.'],
  [3, '<b>Select the columns to be stored.</b> Tick the extra columns you want kept on each person (up to 40). Unticked columns are not stored. Columns that look personal (date of birth, salary, Aadhaar, PAN, address, gender and so on) are marked <i>personal</i> and are <b>never stored</b> while "Never store columns marked personal" stays ticked.'],
  [4, '<b>Preview</b>: a dry run. Nothing is written.'],
  [5, '<b>Import</b>: does it for real.'],
  [6, '<b>Start over</b>: clears everything back to the file box.']
])}
<p>The phone column is the only required one: someone you cannot reach by number is not a contact. The CRM also guesses the phone column from the
values, so it is usually already ticked.</p>
<p>The <b>Tag everyone in this file</b> box is filled with the file’s name. Keep it (every imported person gets that tag, which makes them
easy to find later) or clear it to skip tagging.</p>
<h3>Step 3 · Preview, then import</h3>
${fig('09-import-preview', 'Preview: counts of what would happen, with nothing saved yet.')}
${steps([
  'Press <b>Preview</b>. You see: "N read · N contacts would be created · N updated · N errors".',
  'If a row has a bad number you get a <b>Rows to fix</b> box. Those rows are left out of the import. Press <b>Download these rows (CSV)</b>, fix them in your sheet and upload again.',
  'Press <b>Import</b>. You see "✓ Imported".',
  'Choose what next: <b>View the N imported contacts</b> or <b>Message these people</b> (starts a campaign for exactly this import).'
])}

<p>The list shows the first 50 matches. Use search, tags and the <b>Dates and order</b> section to narrow it
(by when people were added or last imported, and newest, oldest or A–Z).</p>
<h3>Opening a person</h3>
<p>Click a row to open it. You can see when they were added and last imported, add or remove tags (<b>+ tag…</b> then <b>Add</b>),
edit custom fields (<b>Save fields</b>) and mark the person <b>Do not contact</b> (<b>Allow contact</b> reverses it).</p>
${care('<b>Do not contact</b> means: never message this person. Replies and campaigns skip them. Use it for anyone who asks to stop. Only an admin can knowingly override it for one message or one campaign, with a written reason that is saved.')}
<h3>Tags</h3>
<p>A tag is a label such as "pune" or "interview-stage". Add one person at a time by opening their row, add many people at once with
<b>Tag many at once</b> (choose <b>Add tag</b> or <b>Remove tag</b>, pick the tag and who it applies to, press <b>Preview</b>, then <b>Confirm</b>),
or create a new tag in <b>New tag</b>. Tags are how you pick campaign audiences, so tag people as you go.</p>
<h3>Custom fields</h3>
<p><b>Custom fields</b> are extra columns of your own (text, number, date or a pick-list), for example "City". ${admin} Admins add and remove them.
Anything you add can be used in a campaign as <code>{{city}}</code>.</p>
<h3>Making a campaign from people you ticked</h3>
<p>Tick people in the list, open <b>Campaign from checked contacts</b>, type a name and message, choose the number and press
<b>Create draft from checked</b>. People marked do-not-contact cannot be ticked.</p>
<h3>Exporting ${admin}</h3>
<p>Admins see <b>Export CSV</b> and <b>Export vCard</b>. Every export is recorded.</p>

chapter('Campaigns: sending to many people', `

<p><b>It leads the conversation.</b> If your instructions describe a goal (for example: "find out their name, city, years of driving and when they can start"), it answers what the person asks and then asks the next question toward that goal, one at a time.

<li>Turn it off any time: untick <b>AI assistant is on</b> and save.</li>

chapter('Security: encryption keys', `
<p>Messages and WhatsApp sign-ins are stored encrypted. The <b>Security</b> page (admin content) lets an admin change the key that protects them without downtime and without losing anything.</p>
${fig('16-security', 'The Security page: encryption keys.')}
<p>You only need this when you want to <b>rotate</b> the key (for example on a schedule, or if you think it leaked). The page shows the current key version and walks through five steps: make a new key; put it in the server settings and restart; re-encrypt the existing data (a progress bar, with pause and resume); verify that the new key opens everything; retire the old key. Steps 2 and 5 are done on the server by whoever runs it. <b>Back up the current key first</b>: without it, stored data cannot be read.</p>

  ['<b>Sending is spaced out</b>', 'A human types one message at a time. The CRM leaves a few random seconds between messages and "types" before sending.'],
  ['<b>New numbers start slowly</b>', 'A brand-new number that suddenly sends hundreds of messages is the classic ban pattern. The daily allowance grows with time and with replies received.'],
  ['<b>Messages vary</b>', 'Hundreds of identical messages look like spam. Use <code>{{name}}</code> and <code>{option|option}</code> in campaigns.'],
  ['<b>Do-not-contact</b>', 'Being reported is the fastest route to a ban. People who asked to stop are never messaged. Only an admin can knowingly override it, per message or per campaign, with a reason.'],
  ['<b>Mid-conversation and cooldown protection</b>', 'Campaigns skip people a colleague is talking to, and people messaged in the last 14 days.'],
  ['<b>Everything is recorded</b>', 'Overrides, assignments, imports, exports and what the AI did are saved in an audit log with who did them.']

  ['My message is stuck on "⚠ waiting"', 'Read the reason after "waiting:". A wait for its turn clears itself. "The number isn’t connected" means re-link it on Linked numbers.'],
  ['I cannot reply: the box is greyed out', 'Either the chat is assigned to someone else (reassign it to yourself or ask an admin), the number is not connected, or the contact is do-not-contact. The notice above the box says which.'],
  ['Import says "no rows to import"', 'The sheet needs a header row and at least one person under it.'],
  ['Import says the file was already imported', 'The same file cannot be imported twice. Change something in it, or press <b>Upload anyway</b> if you really want to run it again.'],
  ['Some rows were left out of the import', 'Open <b>Rows to fix</b>, download them, correct the numbers in your sheet and import again.'],
  ['A campaign skipped many people', 'Open the campaign and filter by <b>Skipped</b>. Each person has a reason.'],
  ['A campaign paused by itself', 'WhatsApp may be limiting the number. Open <b>Linked numbers</b>, read the banner, and do not resume until it is clear.'],
