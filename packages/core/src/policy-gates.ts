/**
 * The recipient-experience gates.
 *
 * These protect the *person's* experience, which is why an admin may lift them, knowingly, per campaign, with a reason and an audit row:
 *
 *  - **dnc**: the contact is flagged do-not-contact. Unlike the others this protects the person, not the
 *    number, so it is the one an admin should think hardest about lifting — but it is liftable (Kushal,
 *    2026-10-09), per campaign, with a reason, audited;
 *  - **engagement**: another agent owns a live conversation with this person right now, and a
 *    broadcast landing in the middle of it is rude and confusing;
 *  - **cooldown**: this person was already sent a *campaign* message recently. It only warns now (CW-6.6a): the form says how many,
 *    and they are sent;
 *  - **duplicate_campaign**: they are already waiting in another live campaign *on the same sending number*.
 *
 * A blocked recipient is **skipped with a reason, never silently dropped**, so it shows in the
 * campaign's results.
