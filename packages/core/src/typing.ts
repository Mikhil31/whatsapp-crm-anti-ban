/**
 * Typing simulation (D-24): it makes each individual send *look* human. A real person sees the "typing…" bubble for a beat before a message lands; a bot
 * fires instantly with no bubble, and an instant zero-delay send is a documented tell. So before
 * a send the gateway emits a `composing` presence, waits a beat proportional to the message
 * length, then sends — this module computes only that beat.
 *
 * Pure and side-effect-free on purpose: it takes a length and returns milliseconds, so it is
 * unit-testable without a socket, and the gateway owns the actual presence calls and the sleep.

/**
 * Milliseconds "spent typing" per character, and its spread. Gaussian around the mean because

 *
 * This is a **compressed** beat, not literal typing time. The original design framed it as
 * ~45 WPM, which for a paragraph is 30-plus seconds — realistic to *type*, but a half-minute
 * "typing…" bubble before every send would stall the queue for no gain (the tell we
 * are removing is the *instant* send, not a fast one). So the rate is tuned to a plausible pause
 * that stays inside the clamp window for ordinary message lengths and only saturates for very
 * long bodies.
