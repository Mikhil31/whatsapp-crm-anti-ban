/**
 * Bulk sends.
 *
 * The shape of this is decided by one fact: **a campaign must not be able to bury an agent's reply, and must not
 * be a burst.**
 *
 * So a campaign does not queue its messages at launch. Fifty thousand queued rows would sit ahead of a
 * human's reply in the same queue and would have to be individually cancelled to stop the campaign. Instead the
 * `campaign_recipient` rows **are** the queue, and a dispatcher converts them into messages a small batch at a time
 * (how many is the anti-ban policy's say, `campaignBatch`).
 *
 * Pausing is then instant and costs nothing: the dispatcher simply stops looking at it.
