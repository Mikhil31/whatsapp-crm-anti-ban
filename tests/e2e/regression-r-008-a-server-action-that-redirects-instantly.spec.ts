/**
 * R-008 (2026-10-22, area: web-ui, found by: flaky CI, repro loop)
 * What broke: a server action that redirects to the same page could leave the content blank on a production build. The root loading.tsx
 * (a Suspense boundary) plus a slow, heavy target page stalled Next's client router: the address changed but the page never drew.
 *
 * "Tag many at once" with "No tag" chosen is a same-page redirect (/contacts/classic?bulkError=no_tag), so it is the probe: five tries in a row,
 * each must show the explanation within 8 seconds. It only means something on a production build (npm run regress), which is what @smoke runs on.
