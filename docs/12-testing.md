## Who does the testing here?

Funny anywhere else. Here it is a **description of the system this one replaces**: the prior
system had **zero tests** and verified changes by messaging real people from a real WhatsApp
account (`00-prior-art.md`, M20). The testers were the candidates.

And the stakes are worse than an embarrassing bug. Testing in production on this stack means
sending real messages from a real number — and the number is the asset with no recovery path.
A bad loop does not produce a bug report; it produces a permanent ban with no appeal.

So the answer to the question is: **the `fake` adapters do.** With `ChannelProvider` and
`SourceConnector` as ports, the entire pipeline — dispatcher, anti-ban policy, campaigns,
inbox, webhooks — is testable with no phone, no account and no network. That is the bar being
cleared, and it is why the ports exist at all.

## The pyramid

| Layer | Tool | Target | Covers |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Unit** | Vitest | ≥80% core, **100% anti-ban policy + dispatcher** | The gap between sends, the campaign batch, merge policies, phone normalisation, template rendering, identity resolution |
| **Contract** | Vitest + LocalStack, Keycloak, MailHog | Every adapter and every driver | One conformance suite per port — `ChannelProvider`, `SourceConnector`, `StorageDriver`, `AuthProvider`, `QueueDriver`, `EmailDriver`, `KmsDriver`. New adapters are correct by construction; swapping drivers provably changes nothing. |
| **Integration** | Vitest + Testcontainers | Repositories, queues, workers | Real Postgres, real queue, no mocks at the boundary. Migrations up and down. **RLS isolation asserted per table.** |
| **API** | Supertest + Testcontainers | Every endpoint | Happy path, authz matrix (every role × every endpoint), validation, pagination, idempotency, rate limits, error shapes |
| **E2E** | Playwright | Critical journeys | **Built (10 specs):** sign in/out, every page renders, import a CSV and tag it, mass-tag, tag one by hand, build a broadcast (from a tag and from an inline filter), flag do-not-contact, define a custom field. **Still to add:** inbox thread flows, sending verified in CI (needs a fake-number gateway) |
| **Load** | k6 | Throughput and soak | 10k campaign · 100 msg/s inbound burst · 50k-row import · 24 h soak |
| **Security** | ZAP, Semgrep, gitleaks, Trivy, custom | Every PR | OWASP Top 10, cross-tenant IDOR, SSRF, authz bypass, injection |
| **Chaos** | Scripted | Quarterly | Kill Postgres / queue / gateway mid-campaign |
| **Manual** | Runbook | Pre-release | One real number, small scale, against a checklist |

## Regression tests for prior defects

**Bugs found after launch** (reported by a tester, found by the audit, caught in CI) have their own system: the **regression registry** `tests/regression/REGISTRY.md`, where every bug gets an R-number and a test with `[R-nnn]` in its title, a bug-fix gate in CI, a production-build smoke run on every PR and a nightly full run. The whole flow, from report to merge, is in [`39-bug-workflow.md`](39-bug-workflow.md) and the mechanics are in [`tests/regression/README.md`](../tests/regression/README.md). The table below is the older list of defects from the previous system (`M*` in `00-prior-art.md`).

Every `M*` in `00-prior-art.md` gets a named regression test. The highest-value ones:

| Defect | Test |
|---|---|
| M7 empty-string dedup | Two blank-email contacts stay two contacts |
| M8 unnormalised phones | Five formats of one number resolve to one contact |
| M9 blind overwrite | Sparse re-import destroys nothing |
| M11 caps counted rounds | Cap counts messages, including agent replies |
| M12 send path bypass | No route or job can reach a provider except via the dispatcher |
| M13 in-process state | Multi-worker run produces correct shared-budget behaviour |
| M26 poison message | One unresolvable recipient does not affect the session or other sends |
| M31 context bleed | Two conversations with one contact stay separate |

## Preset and resource testing

- **E2E runs on all three presets** — `lean`, `standard`, and a paid-equivalent (LocalStack S3
  + KMS + SES, Keycloak OIDC). A test passing on one and failing on another means the
  abstraction leaked, and the build fails.
- **`lean` is the preset that must never break** — it is the default and what most self-hosters
  will run.
- **Resource budget as a test**: a CI job runs `lean` under a hard **2 GB memory limit** with a
  synthetic Solo-tier workload and fails on OOM or on exceeding the documented footprint by
  more than 20%. This keeps `19-capacity.md` honest and stops the default quietly growing past
  the box it promises to fit.

## Test data

**Synthetic only** (M19 — the old repo committed a real-looking candidate record with name,
mobile, DOB, address and salary). A fixture library builds orgs, contacts and conversations
deterministically from a seed, so failures reproduce exactly.

A deliberately hostile ingestion fixture is maintained as a first-class asset: mixed date
formats, `19 Year(s) 0 Month(s)`, lakh/crore salaries, duplicate emails, blank emails, phones
in five formats, non-UTF8 bytes, 50k rows.

## What runs on every pull request (GitHub Actions)

Three checks appear on a PR. They are the same things `npm run verify` runs locally, split so a failure points
at one cause. Workflow: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.

| Check | Time | What it does | What a failure means |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ci / check** | ~2 min | Starts a real Postgres (and an S3 emulator, moto, for the storage contract suite), migrates the test database, runs typecheck (API and web), lint (including the "every function has a comment saying why" rule), the whole vitest suite (unit, contract, integration, the RLS isolation tests), and re-applies the migrations to prove they are idempotent. | The code does not compile, breaks a rule, a behaviour regressed, or a migration is not safe to re-run. |
| **ci / e2e** | ~2 min | Builds the schema, creates the e2e admin and seeds the test org, starts the API, the gateway on the in-memory fake channel, and the web app, then drives a real Chromium through the browser specs: login and logout, inbox, contacts and tags, import, broadcasts, do-not-contact, numbers, saved audiences, and a message sent end to end. | A screen or flow a person uses is broken, even though the unit tests pass. |
| **ci / secrets-scan** | ~10 s | Runs gitleaks over the diff for API keys, tokens and private keys. The CI-only throwaway keys are marked `gitleaks:allow`. | A secret was about to be committed. Remove it and rotate it; deleting the commit is not enough. |

Notes:
- All three are required to be green before merge; none of them can touch a real WhatsApp number.
- Locally, `npm run verify` runs the same stages plus a scripted no-send flow (see
  [`24 · Local testing`](24-local-testing.md)). `npm run test:live` is the only thing that uses a real number
  and it is never part of CI.

## Gates

| Stage | Must pass |
|---|---|
| **PR** | lint (incl. the JSDoc rule) · typecheck · unit · contract · integration · API · Semgrep · gitleaks |
| **main** | + E2E on all presets · resource budget |
| **Release** | + load · chaos · restore drill · manual checklist |

## Coverage

≥80% on `core`, `ingestion`, `channels`. **100% on `antiban` and the dispatcher** (NFR-22) —
these are the components where a gap is a banned number or a duplicate send, not a bug report.

Coverage is a floor, not a goal. A PR that raises coverage while testing nothing meaningful is
a review failure.
