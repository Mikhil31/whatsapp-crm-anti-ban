One file per module. Each carries: purpose, user stories, acceptance criteria (`AC-*`),
API surface, test cases (`TC-*`), and open questions. Requirement ids (`FR-*`) refer to
`../02-requirements.md`; defect ids (`M*`) to `../00-prior-art.md`.

Status legend: **✅** built (V1 complete or all but trivia) · **⚠️** partial (a working first
slice, remainder tracked in `../21-deferred.md`) · **partial / seam only** as noted.
