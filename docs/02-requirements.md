# 02 · Requirements

Numbered so everything downstream — features, tests, acceptance criteria — can cite them.
`FR` functional, `NFR` non-functional, `CON` constraint. Priority: **V1** must ship,
**V2** next, **V3** later.

## Constraints (non-negotiable, mostly external)

| id | Constraint | Consequence |
|---|---|---|
| CON-1 | Baileys is unofficial and violates WhatsApp's ToS; any number can be banned without appeal | Anti-ban engine is mandatory, not a feature. Business-critical traffic routes to the official API. |
| CON-2 | Meta charges per template message and enforces messaging tiers (250 → 1k → 10k → 100k → unlimited) and a quality rating | The dispatcher must track tier and quality and refuse to exceed them |
| CON-3 | Meta's 24-hour service window: freeform messages are only legal inside it | Capability declaration per provider; the dispatcher decides template vs freeform, never the caller |
| CON-4 | Meta webhooks require a 2xx within ~3 s and retry with backoff for up to 7 days | Webhook handler verifies, enqueues, returns. No processing inline. |
| CON-5 | Operators are subject to **their own jurisdiction's** messaging/consent law (DPDP, GDPR, TCPA, …) — the product bakes in none of them | Provide jurisdiction-neutral tooling: `do_not_contact`, opt-out handling, audit trail, export/erasure. Enforce no specific regime; compliance is the operator's |
| CON-6 | Must run entirely on free, self-hostable software | Every paid dependency has a free default driver |
| CON-7 | Must be operable by one person on one VPS | `lean` preset; no component required that a single operator cannot reason about |
| CON-8 | Baileys 7.x is currently a release candidate with breaking changes | Pin an exact version; keep the adapter surface thin |

## Functional requirements

### Contacts & identity
| id | Requirement | Pri |
|---|---|---|
| FR-1 | Contacts with user-defined custom fields (typed, with per-field merge policy) | V1 |
| FR-2 | A contact has many identities (`phone`, `email`, `wa_jid`, `wa_lid`, `external`); inbound resolves on identity, not on the contact row | V1 |
| FR-3 | Phone numbers normalised to E.164 at every boundary, with a per-source default country | V1 |

| FR-5 | Duplicate detection and a merge flow with a preview of what would be overwritten | V1 |
| FR-6 | Static lists and dynamic segments (saved filters) | V1 |
| FR-7 | `do_not_contact` flag with reason and timestamp, honoured by every send path | V1 |
| FR-8 | **Optional** per-contact consent/opt-in record (source, evidence, timestamp) the operator maps to their own jurisdiction — not tied to any regime | V2 |
| FR-9 | Contact data export and per-contact delete — the mechanism for any "remove my data" request, whatever regime requires it | V2 |

### Anti-ban (detail in `08-antiban.md`)

| id | Requirement | Pri |
|---|---|---|
| FR-47 | Connector framework: a new source type is one class plus a config schema | V1 |

## Non-functional requirements

### Performance & capacity
| id | Requirement |
|---|---|
| NFR-1 | API p95 < 300 ms, p99 < 1 s for read endpoints at the Small-team tier |
| NFR-2 | Inbox message delivery to a connected agent < 1 s from provider receipt |
| NFR-3 | Ingest ≥ 1,000 rows/second on the Small-team tier |
| NFR-4 | A 10,000-recipient campaign enqueues in < 5 s (execution is deliberately slow — see CON-1) |
| NFR-5 | `lean` preset runs the Solo tier within **2 GB RAM**, enforced by a CI memory-limit test |
| NFR-6 | No HTTP request performs unbounded work; everything long-running is a job with progress |

### Reliability
| id | Requirement |
|---|---|
| NFR-7 | No message is sent twice, ever — idempotency on `provider_message_id` and job keys |
| NFR-8 | No inbound message is lost: raw payloads persisted before processing and replayable |
| NFR-9 | A poison message is quarantined after N attempts and never takes down a session (M26) |
| NFR-10 | Killing any process mid-campaign loses no state and creates no duplicates |
| NFR-11 | RPO ≤ 24 h, RTO ≤ 1 h, proven by a restore drill that runs in CI |
| NFR-12 | Zero-downtime deploys: expand → migrate → contract, health-gated, auto-rollback |

### Security & privacy

|---|---|
| NFR-13 | Message bodies and contact identifiers encrypted at rest, with versioned keys and online rotation |
| NFR-14 | Tenant isolation enforced by Postgres RLS, asserted per table by tests |
| NFR-15 | No secret in code, image or logs; config validated at boot with a hard crash if incomplete |
| NFR-16 | All user-supplied URLs SSRF-guarded (webhooks, REST sources) |
| NFR-17 | Every state change produces an audit row with a non-null actor |

| NFR-20 | Every alert links to a runbook entry that says what to do |
| NFR-21 | Every class, function, exported constant and type carries a 1–4 line comment, lint-enforced |
| NFR-22 | ≥ 80% coverage on core; **100% on the anti-ban policy and the dispatcher** |
| NFR-23 | Adding a channel, source or infrastructure driver requires no change to calling code |
| NFR-24 | The free/`lean` path is the primary tested path in CI |
| NFR-25 | Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA for the inbox and campaign builder |
