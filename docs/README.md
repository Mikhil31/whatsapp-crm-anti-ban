# Documentation

**Just want to run it? → [Getting started](../GETTING_STARTED.md)** (at the repo root) takes a
fresh clone to a working, signed-in instance.

**New here? Start with [20 · Orientation](20-orientation.md).** It explains the project, the
technology and every piece of jargon from zero — no knowledge of TypeScript, Node, Postgres or
WhatsApp's API assumed. It also decodes the `M`, `P`, `F` and `FR` codes used throughout.
