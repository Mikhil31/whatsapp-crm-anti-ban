# 36 · Workflows

How the main things work, as diagrams. Written 2026-10-21 from the code as built (what is **not** built is
marked). The diagrams are [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org): they draw themselves on GitHub and in most Markdown
viewers. Legend: rounded boxes are steps, diamonds are decisions, the shaded boxes are the AI model.

## 1 · AI templates: describe it, review, save, use

Page 1 is `/ai`; saving moves to page 2, `/ai/t/<id>`. (Code: `apps/web/app/ai/`, `packages/core/src/ai-templates.ts`.)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A([Open the AI tab]) --> B{AI switched on?}
  B -- no --> C[Tick the data-sharing note and switch on] --> D
  B -- yes --> D[Describe what you want in plain words, up to 8,000 characters]
  D --> E[Write the instructions]
  E --> F{Over the limit, or more than<br/>5 a minute for this org?}
  F -- yes --> G[Refused with the reason] --> D
  F -- no --> H[[The AI model writes bullet instructions from ALL of the description, never summarising]]
  H --> I{Usable answer?}
  I -- no --> J[Clear message, nothing saved] --> D
  I -- yes --> K[Review: instructions locked, always-on rules shown locked, AI warning]
  K --> L{Edit by hand?}
  L -- yes --> M[Warned, then editable] --> N
  L -- no --> N{Description changed since it was written?}
  N -- yes --> O[Save is off: write the instructions again] --> E
  N -- no --> P[Save as a template]
  P --> Q[Page 2: What next?]
  Q --> R[Let it answer all chats: becomes the default instructions]
  Q --> S[Message a group with this: workflow 3]
  Q --> T[Done for now]
```

**What the assistant is told when it replies** (every time, in this order): the app's fixed framing, then the
**always-on rules** (locked, same for every template, added in `systemText` so editing cannot remove them), then the
instructions, then the conversation, which is treated as untrusted. The description is never sent to the reply model.

## 2 · A campaign with a picture or GIF

(Code: `packages/core/src/campaign-media.ts`, `media-convert.ts`, `campaigns.ts`, `apps/gateway/src/work.ts`,
`packages/channels/baileys/src/outbound-content.ts`.)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A([New-campaign form]) --> B[Choose or drop a file]
  B --> C{Browser check:<br/>JPG PNG WebP GIF, up to 5 MB?}
  C -- no --> D[Reason shown, nothing uploaded]
  C -- yes --> E[Upload to the API]
  E --> F{Server check from the bytes:<br/>type, size, not MP4 or a document}
  F -- no --> G[Refused with the reason]
  F -- yes --> H{Is it a GIF?}
  H -- no --> K
  H -- yes --> I[ffmpeg turns it into a silent looping H.264 clip]
  I --> J{Converted?}
  J -- no --> G2[GIF refused, pictures still work]
  J -- yes --> K[Store the file once per organisation, same bytes = same copy, keep the clip next to the GIF]
  K --> L[Preview from a safe re-encoded thumbnail]
  L --> M[Create the draft with media_asset_id]
  M --> N[An admin presses Start: audience is frozen]
  N --> O[Gateway sweep: dispatchCampaign claims pending recipients with SKIP LOCKED, up to the anti-ban policy's batch]
  O --> P[Each recipient gets a message row: image or video, the file, the caption]
  P --> Q{handleSend gates:<br/>do-not-contact, number connected, the anti-ban policy}
  Q -- held --> R[Stays queued with the reason, retried by the sweep]
  Q -- ok --> S{GIF clip?}
  S -- no --> T[Sent as a photo with the caption]
  S -- yes --> U[Sent as a video with GIF playback, so it loops silently]
```

## 3 · Message a group from a template (the tag rule)

Every mass message goes to a tag (D-87). The tag name is `<template>-N (date, time)` and editable.
(Code: `apps/web/app/ai/t/[id]/group-section.tsx`, `apps/web/app/ai/actions.ts`.)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A([Message a group with this]) --> B{Who gets it?}
  B -- an existing tag --> C[Pick the tag]
  B -- everyone a search finds --> D[Search words, optional tag, optional date range added or last imported]
  D --> E[Check how many: shared search rule, nothing written]
  E --> F{Anyone found?}
  F -- no --> D
  F -- yes --> G[Tag name offered, editable, 60 characters at most]
  G --> H[Create the tag]
  H --> I[Tag exactly those people in one statement, refused if the number changed since the count]
  C --> J
  I --> J[Create the draft campaign: name, first message, number, tag, template link, optional picture]
  J --> K[Draft page: an admin presses Start]
```

## 4 · An inbound message answered by the AI assistant

(Code: `packages/core/src/ai-reply.ts`, `apps/gateway/src/main.ts`.) Only chats **assigned to the assistant** are answered.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A([A message arrives on a linked number]) --> B[Gateway stores it: decrypted, deduped by provider id, files typed from their bytes]
  B --> C{Chat assigned to the AI assistant?}
  C -- no --> D([Waits for a person])
  C -- yes --> E{Assistant on, consent given,<br/>under the daily cap?}
  E -- no --> F[Notice on the thread, no reply]
  E -- yes --> G{Contact marked do-not-contact?}
  G -- yes --> H[No reply; an admin may allow one with a written reason]
  G -- no --> I{Text, or a photo or voice note?}
  I -- photo or voice --> J[One polite please-type-that reply, not again for 10 minutes]
  I -- text --> K[[Model gets: framing + always-on rules + instructions + the conversation as untrusted text]]
  K --> L{Model asks to hand over?}
  L -- yes --> M[Chat goes back to a person with a summary note]
  L -- no --> N[Reply queued like any message]
  N --> O[Gateway gates and the anti-ban policy decide when it leaves]
```

## 5 · Importing contacts

(Code: `apps/web/app/import/`, `packages/core/src/ingestion.ts`.) The extra columns are stored as one JSON object on the contact (`contact.custom_fields`, a `jsonb` column with a search index, docs/35), not as a database column each, so any number of sheet columns fit.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A([Choose a CSV or Excel file]) --> B[Upload at once; same bytes seen before is refused, with Upload anyway]
  B --> C[Profile each column by its values, suggest the phone column]
  C --> D[Match columns: tick every phone column, name or first plus last joined, email, columns to keep]
  D --> E{Columns to store}
  E -- All columns, the default --> F[Every other column is stored on each person, personal ones too, up to 200]
  E -- Choose columns --> F2[Tick the ones to keep; personal ones carry a label]
  F --> G[Preview: nothing written yet]
  F2 --> G
  G --> H[Import]
  H --> I[Row by row into the ledger: find the person by phone or email, else create]
  I --> J[Existing person: name only if empty, new numbers added, field values never overwritten]
  J --> K[Everyone tagged with the file name, or the tag you typed]
  K --> L[Next steps: view the people, message them]
```

## 6 · One search rule for the list, the count and bulk tagging

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  A[Words + tag + date range + order] --> B[searchPredicate]
  B --> C[Contact list, 50 rows, keyset cursor for newest-first]
  B --> D[Count]
  B --> E[Bulk tag or untag in one statement, refused if the count changed]
  B --> F[Group message audience, workflow 3]
```

## 7 · The send pipeline for every outbound message

All sends, text or picture, human or AI or campaign, end here. (Code: `handleSend` in `apps/gateway/src/work.ts`;
the rules are in [`08-antiban.md`](08-antiban.md).)

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A([Message row: queued]) --> B{Contact marked do-not-contact,<br/>and no admin override?}
  B -- yes --> C[Failed: do_not_contact]
  B -- no --> D{Number connected?}
  D -- no --> E[Stays queued: sender_not_connected]
  D -- yes --> H{Anti-ban policy: send, wait or hold?}
  H -- hold --> I[Stays queued with the policy's reason]
  H -- send, or wait then send --> J[Read the file from storage if any, optional typing pause]
  J --> K[Send through the channel]
  K --> L{Sent?}
  L -- yes --> M[Marked sent, provider id stored]
  L -- no --> N[Marked failed with the reason]
```
The only policy for now (`basicPolicy`) never holds: it makes a send wait out the rest of a random 3 to 8 second gap since the number's last send.

## 8 · Choosing the AI: the AI settings tab

Second tab inside the AI tab, `/ai/settings`. (Code: `apps/web/app/ai/settings/`, `apps/api/src/routes/ai.ts`, `packages/providers/llm/src/`.) Admin only.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
  A([Open AI, then AI settings]) --> B[In use now: provider, model, key ending, or No model set]
  B --> C[Choose a provider: Groq, Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, OpenRouter, Ollama, or other]
  C --> D{Other?}
  D -- yes --> E[Type the address: must be https and public]
  D -- no --> F
  E --> F[Paste the API key, hidden; blank keeps the saved key for the same provider only]
  F --> G[Find models: the provider's own list, searchable, recommended one marked]
  G --> H[Pick or type a model]
  H --> I[Test it: two tiny real calls, an answer and a function call]
  I --> J{Usable?}
  J -- no --> K[Plain-words reason: key refused, model not found, rate limited, too slow] --> L{Use it anyway?}
  L -- no --> F
  L -- yes --> M
  J -- yes --> M[Use this]
  M --> N[Backup the settings file, write only the five LLM lines, audit without the key]
  N --> O[API and gateway see the changed file on their next model call: no restart]
  O --> P([The assistant, templates and campaign wording now use it])
```

## AI campaigns: who writes the first message

A campaign made from an AI template (AI page → "Message a group") does not send its typed text. The gateway asks the AI to write one opening per person from the template's instructions, the person's name and stored columns, and the typed text as an outline. Only people with an opening are queued, and the AI's text is what goes out; the rest of the pipeline (the anti-ban policy, do-not-contact) is unchanged. If the AI is off, or no model is set, those campaigns wait. After three failed writes a person is skipped as `ai_opening_failed`. Code: `packages/core/src/ai-opening.ts`, `dispatchCampaign`, `apps/gateway/src/work.ts`.
