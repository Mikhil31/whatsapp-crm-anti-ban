# Database reference (generated)

Generated from the live database on 2026-10-30 by `npm run db:docs`. **Do not edit by hand**; change the schema or `packages/db/src/table-notes.ts` and regenerate.
For the optimisations and the main queries, see [`35-database-and-queries.md`](../35-database-and-queries.md).

**32 tables, 70 foreign keys, 28 row-level-security policies, 3 triggers, 2 functions.**

Every tenant table has `org_id` and a row-level-security policy: the app runs each request as the restricted `crm_app` role with `app.org_id` set, so a forgotten `WHERE org_id` returns nothing instead of leaking.

## Tables by group

### Audit and health

| Table | What it is for | Rows now |
|---|---|---|
| [`ai_run`](#ai_run) | One row each time the AI assistant sends, tries, or is held back (and why), with the model and token counts, so its work and cost can be checked. | 0 |
| [`audit_log`](#audit_log) | Append-only record of who did what and when: sign-ins, reassignments, overrides, exports. The app role cannot update or delete rows. | 7 |
| [`key_rotation_state`](#key_rotation_state) | One row for the whole install: whether the background re-encryption of a key rotation is paused, and how much it has moved. Not per org, because the encryption key is not. | 0 |
| [`sender_health_event`](#sender_health_event) | A timeline of what happened to a number: refused by WhatsApp, logged out unasked, or removed on the phone. | 3 |

### Campaigns

| Table | What it is for | Rows now |
|---|---|---|
| [`ai_job`](#ai_job) | The AI assistant’s waiting list: instructions and wording requests, run one at a time per org. Shows who is queued, what is running and what finished; only a queued one can be cancelled. | 2 |
| [`ai_setting`](#ai_setting) | The AI assistant’s switch for an org: on or off, its instructions, a daily message limit, and who accepted the data-sharing note. Off until an admin accepts. | 1 |
| [`ai_template`](#ai_template) | A saved AI template: what an owner described in plain words and the instructions the AI wrote from it, kept together to pick again. The locked always-on rules are not stored here; they are added on every reply. | 0 |
| [`campaign`](#campaign) | A bulk send: the message, the number it goes from, its audience, its state (draft, running, paused…) and results. | 5 |
| [`campaign_recipient`](#campaign_recipient) | One person in a campaign. Acts as the queue: the gateway turns recipients into messages a small batch at a time, and records why anyone was skipped. | 50 |

### Contacts

| Table | What it is for | Rows now |
|---|---|---|
| [`contact`](#contact) | A person you talk to: display name, custom fields, source and a do-not-contact flag. Phone numbers and emails live in contact_identity, not here. | 63 |
| [`contact_identity`](#contact_identity) | One way to reach or recognise a contact: a phone number, an email, or a WhatsApp privacy address. A contact can have several. | 63 |
| [`contact_tag`](#contact_tag) | Which contacts carry which tags. One row per contact and tag. | 0 |
| [`custom_field`](#custom_field) | The vocabulary of extra fields an org has defined for contacts (city, experience…), with a type, so values are checked and {{city}} works in campaigns. | 0 |
| [`segment`](#segment) | A saved audience: a stored filter whose matching people are recomputed whenever it is used. | 0 |
| [`tag`](#tag) | A label such as "pune" or "interview-stage". Unique per org by name. | 0 |

### Import

| Table | What it is for | Rows now |
|---|---|---|
| [`import_row`](#import_row) | The ledger for one row of an upload: what it said, what the dry run decided, and which contact it produced. | 0 |
| [`import_run`](#import_run) | One uploaded spreadsheet and what became of it: file hash (to refuse duplicates), counts, and whether it was committed or superseded. | 0 |

### Inbox

| Table | What it is for | Rows now |
|---|---|---|
| [`canned_reply`](#canned_reply) | A saved reply an agent can insert with a shortcut, with {{name}}-style placeholders. | 0 |
| [`conversation`](#conversation) | One chat thread between one contact and one of your numbers. Holds the owner, open/closed status, unread count and timing. | 64 |
| [`conversation_participant`](#conversation_participant) | Extra people on a chat beside its owner. Participants may reply; only admins add or remove them. | 0 |
| [`conversation_presence`](#conversation_presence) | Who has a chat open right now, refreshed by a heartbeat every few seconds. Throwaway rows, never history. | 0 |
| [`internal_note`](#internal_note) | A team-only note on a thread. Kept apart from message so a note can never be sent to the customer. | 0 |
| [`media_asset`](#media_asset) | An attachment file: its type (decided from the file’s bytes), size and storage key. The bytes live in the storage driver, not the database. | 0 |
| [`message`](#message) | One message in or out of a thread: encrypted body, delivery status, who sent it, optional attachment and campaign. Inserting an outbound queued row wakes the gateway. | 81 |

### WhatsApp numbers

| Table | What it is for | Rows now |
|---|---|---|
| [`channel_auth_state`](#channel_auth_state) | The encrypted login credentials Baileys needs to keep a number linked across restarts. Losing the encryption key loses these. | 0 |
| [`channel_session`](#channel_session) | The live connection state of a number (connected, QR waiting, unlink requested). Churns constantly; three triggers here wake the gateway. | 0 |
| [`sender_identity`](#sender_identity) | One of your WhatsApp numbers: its name, phone number and whether it is linked. | 15 |

### Workspaces and people

| Table | What it is for | Rows now |
|---|---|---|
| [`api_key`](#api_key) | Machine access for integrations such as JobPortal: a hashed secret plus the scopes it may use. Also looked up before the org is known. | 1 |
| [`app_user`](#app_user) | A person who can sign in: name, email, password hash. Belongs to an org through org_membership, not directly. | 4 |
| [`org`](#org) | A customer workspace. Every other table points back to one org, and row-level security keeps each org’s rows invisible to the rest. | 15 |
| [`org_membership`](#org_membership) | Links a person to an org and gives them a role (admin or agent). Roles live here so one person could join several orgs later. | 4 |
| [`session`](#session) | A signed-in browser session for the web app. Looked up before the org is known, so it has no row-level security. | 3 |
